            <p class=" ex1 ">A dragonfly is an insect belonging to the order <i lang="lat ">Odonata</i>, infraorder <i lang="lat ">Anisoptera</i> (from Greek <i lang="gre ">ἄνισος</i> anisos, " unequal " and <i lang="gre ">πτερόν</i> pteron, "wing ", because the hindwing
                is broader than the forewing). Adult dragonflies are characterized by large, multifaceted eyes, two pairs of strong, transparent wings, sometimes with coloured patches, and an elongated body. Dragonflies can be mistaken for the related
                group, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damselfly " target="new " alt="damselflies ">damselflies</a> <i lang=" lat ">(Zygoptera)</i>, which are similar in structure, though usually lighter in build; however, the wings of most dragonflies
                are held flat and away from the body, while damselflies hold the wings folded at rest, along or above the abdomen. Dragonflies are agile fliers, while damselflies have a weaker, fluttery flight. Many dragonflies have brilliant iridescent
                or metallic colours produced by structural coloration, making them conspicuous in flight. An adult dragonfly 's compound eyes have nearly 24,000 <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/ommatidium " target="new ">ommatidia</a> each.</p>

            <p class="ex1">Dragonflies and their relatives are an ancient group. The oldest fossils are of the Protodonata from the 325 Mya Upper Carboniferous of Europe, a group that included the largest insect that ever lived, Meganeuropsis permiana from the Early
                Permian, with a wingspan around 750 mm (30 in);[3] their fossil record ends with the Permian–Triassic extinction event (about 247 Mya). The Protanisoptera, another ancestral group which lacks certain wing vein characters found in modern
                Odonata, lived from the Early to Late Permian age until the end Permian event, and are known from fossil wings from current day United States, Russia, and Australia, suggesting they might have been cosmopolitan in distribution. The forerunners
                of modern Odonata are included in a clade called the Panodonata, which include the basal Zygoptera (damselflies) and the Anisoptera (true dragonflies).[4] Today there are some 3000 species extant around the world.[5][6]Fossils of very
                large dragonfly ancestors in the Protodonata are found from 325 million years ago (Mya) in Upper Carboniferous rocks; these had wingspans up to about 750 mm (30 in).</p>
            <p>
                <p class="ex1">Dragonflies (suborder Anisoptera) are heavy-bodied, strong-flying insects that hold their wings horizontally both in flight and at rest. By contrast, damselflies (suborder Zygoptera) have slender bodies and fly more weakly; most species
                    fold their wings over the abdomen when stationary, and the eyes are well separated on the sides of the head. An adult dragonfly has three distinct segments, the head, thorax, and abdomen as in all insects. It has a chitinous exoskeleton
                    of hard plates held together with flexible membranes. The head is large with very short antennae. It is dominated by the two compound eyes, which cover most of its surface. The compound eyes are made up of ommatidia, the numbers being
                    greater in the larger species. Aeshna interrupta has 22650 ommatidia of two varying sizes, 4500 being large. The facets facing downward tend to be smaller. Petalura gigantea has 23890 ommatidia of just one size. These facets provide
                    complete vision in the frontal hemisphere of the dragonfly.The compound eyes meet at the top of the head (except in the Petaluridae and Gomphidae, as also in the genus Epiophlebia). Also, they have three simple eyes or ocelli. The
                    mouthparts are adapted for biting with a toothed jaw; the flap-like labrum, at the front of the mouth, can be shot rapidly forward to catch prey. The head has a system for locking it in place that consists of muscles and small hairs
                    on the back of the head that grip structures on the front of the first thoracic segment. This arrester system is unique to the Odonata, and is activated when feeding and during tandem flight. </p>
