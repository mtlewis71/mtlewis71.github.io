    <p class="ex1">Dragonflies are represented in human culture on artifacts such as pottery, rock paintings, statues and Art Nouveau jewelry. They are used in traditional medicine in Japan and China, and caught for food in Indonesia. They are symbols of courage, strength,
        and happiness in Japan. Their bright colours and agile flight are admired in the poetry of Lord Tennyson and the prose of H. E. Bates. For some Native American tribes, dragonflies represent swiftness and activity; for the Navajo, they symbolize
        pure water. They are a common motif in Zuni pottery; stylized as a double-barred cross, they appear in Hopi rock art and on Pueblo necklaces. They have been used in traditional medicine in Japan and China. In Indonesia, adults are caught on poles
        made sticky with birdlime, then fried in oil as a delicacy. Images of dragonflies are common in Art Nouveau, especially in jewellery designs. They have also been used as a decorative motif on fabrics and home furnishings. Douglas, a British motorcycle
        manufacturer based in Bristol, named its innovatively designed postwar 350-cc flat-twin model the Dragonfly.</p>

    <p class="ex1">[However], in Europe, dragonflies have often been seen as sinister. Some English vernacular names, such as "horse-stinger", "devil's darning needle", and "ear cutter", link them with evil or injury. Swedish folklore holds that the devil uses dragonflies
        to weigh people's souls. The Norwegian name for dragonflies is Ã˜yenstikker ("eye-poker"), and in Portugal, they are sometimes called tira-olhos ("eyes-snatcher"). They are often associated with snakes, as in the Welsh name gwas-y-neidr, "adder's
        servant". The Southern United States terms "snake doctor" and "snake feeder" refer to a folk belief that dragonflies catch insects for snakes or follow snakes around and stitch them back together if they are injured. And yet, more recently, more
        recently, dragonfly watching has become popular in America as some birdwatchers seek new groups to observe.</p>
